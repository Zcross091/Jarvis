# Jarvis
An AI that uses Wikipedia to answer question and uses ChatGPT framework as well as human like speech with ChatGPT 3.5


# IMPORTANT NOTE TO RUN JARVIS

To activate the AI, you must say Jarvis, and it will start listening. If you don't say anything for the next 5 seconds, then Jarvis will stop listening and wait for you to say Jarvis again.

If you say Jarvis and start giving commands, then the timer will pause and after you have stopped speaking, the AI will wait 5 seconds before confirming the command and answering the question.
